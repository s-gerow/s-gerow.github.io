  <h1 >Seth Gerow</h1>
  <p>
    Seth Gerow is a fourth year undergraduate student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) pursuing an accelerated B.S./M.S. degree in Engineering Physics. 
    He will graduate in May 2026 and begin official graduate studies. He is currently an undergraduate research assistance in the Space and Atmospheric Instrumentation Lab (SAIL) under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Riousset. 
    He started this role in his sohphomore year and his contributions will be the focus of his master's thesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seth is completing his B.S. in engineering physics with a specialization in spacecraft systems and two minor courses of study in astronomy and astrophysics and 
    applied mathematics. Throughout the four years pursuing this degree he completed several projects to enhance his learned skills. These projects included: designing 
    a prototype satellite capable of following a light source 360º around on battery power; designing a retarding potential analyser for use on a CubeSat or sounding rocket 
    to measure ion density and temperature; developing a numerical kinetic model of a plasma propulsion engine; and, building a helmholtz coil to study its magnetic properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to his coursework, Seth has been employed as an undergraduate research assistant at SAIL where his research primarily focusses on the study of electrical 
    discharges and the impact of the secondary ionization in low temperature, low current gas breakdowns. His role involved the conversion of an experimental BEnch for Automated 
    Measurement of Electrical Discharges (BeAMED) from LABVIEW to Python and subsequent hardware upgrades and implementation. This project gave him ample experience with many 
    different bench-top experimental instruments and software, such as oscilloscopes, digital multimeters, high voltage power supplies, pressure sensors, vacuum chambers, Python, 
    and LABVIEW. He also developed experience with electrical engineering software for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs), wiring diagrams, and electrical schematics, such as Multisim and KiCAD. 
  </p>
  <p>  
    During his employment in SAIL, Seth also worked with Dr. Riousset to develop a self-guided, online course to teach new research students to use Python in a 
    variety of applications such as robotics, data analysis, plasma physics, and astrophysics: Project PyTHAGORA (Python Training for Heliophysics, Astronomy, and 
    Geosciences: an Opencourse for Reserachers with Applications). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Seth also was elected the principle investigator on a student-led undergraduate reserach project, Project SHRED (Surfing Hydrodynamic Research using Engineering Design),
    where he led a team of 5-10 fellow engineering students. Project SHRED's science goal was to systematically analyze and design surf board fins to maximize hydro-dynamic 
    efficiency by incorperating elements of aerospace engineering and geometric analysis. The team tested a 3D printed, carbon-fiber composite surfboard fin in the ERAU MicaPlex 
    subsonic wind tunnel in 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his free time, Seth likes to read, camp, surf, rock climb, and tinker with personal projects. Currently he is building a Raspberry Pi based Network Access Storage (NAS) 
    for streaming his digital media collection and learning how server architecture works. He is also developing a particle accelerator tycoon video game.
